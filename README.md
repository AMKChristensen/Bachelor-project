# Bachelor-project
A repo for the files used in my bachelors thesis.

This project only works with the 'Advection' project by Matthias Wiesenberger.
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/advection

Assuming the advection project has been downloaded, the 'Project' folder can simply be put into the 'advection' folder alongside all of the jupyter notebooks and .cpp files.
